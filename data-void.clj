I had the choice between exploring a section of Khaydarin Nebula, the largest Nebula ever detected that the Space station has been mapping for decades, or witness and map the birth of a new star in the Dingus sector. Obviously, this was not even a match. New stars are born constantly, but the Khaydarin Nebula.. Now that was a thing. Many anomalies never mapped before were discovered there and I was anxious to become part of the team. I packed my things and embarked."

The amount of times I heard him mention his deceased mother made me weary. A momma's boy as my roommate, just what I've always wanted. Adam was the astrophysicist of the trip. It was his job to predict any anomalies that could potentially be present during our surveys. I didn't trust him too much to do his job, but since no accidents had happened in over 20 years I figured there wasn't really any need for concern.

Every colour imaginable was present in the clouds of dust, hydrogen, helium and all sorts of undefined gases throughout the nebula, and it was up to me, the technician of the group, to begin the procedure to scan the surface. I started the probe launch sequence and put on my face encapsulating visor to follow its path. Halfway through the trajectory I heard noises. There shouldn't be any noises in space, so I stopped the probe, took off my helmet and saw Adam screaming something indecipherable at me. I figured he was just talking about his mother again, felt a sudden upwelling of anger that I had been holding back the entire journey and knocked him out, then continued my survey."

I had hoped to explore more of life, but one does not pick their own fate. As I tried to become more aware of my own, I felt a pull. I didn't know what to think of it. Everything was so foreign to me; senses felt entirely different as they had before. I had no limbs to control, no heartbeat pumping blood through my veins, and no warmth.

My senses became colder and colder as I noticed the energies disappearing in what seemed to be a great void. Was this a portal into the beyond, or a black hole that would terminate the last of my existence? Though my experience in the afterlife had been less than kind, I wasn't in the mood to end my second being this quickly. With all my willpower I attempted to resist the pull when I noticed the pull did not come from the void, but from three distinct energy sources near it, seemingly feeding it. I wondered..."

   "By the Gods, what has happened to me? One moment I could see clear as Odin, the next, nothing but shades of black and white. Despite the lack of frost in space, it felt colder than the coldest winters preluding Ragnarok were described. I'd heard of how that went down. Always considered a myth back on earth until three consecutive winters passed in 2034. Almost all plant and animal life had ceased, and anything that wasn't vanquished met its end by the following wave of flames. I wondered if my fate would be similar. If heat would follow the cold of today. Would Surt come for me? Is that what laid behind the threshold where light and dark meet? The powers of our gods were always thought to be limited to that of Earth itself, yet this force I felt was undeniable. The only problem was that there were no valkyries to take me to Valhalla. Only lost souls, just as confused if not more so scattered all around me."

   "I was reminded of one being in specific. Loki, the god of deceit. An experience like my own would be something he could concoct. Could it be that he set up the accident all by himself? Was he responsible for creating this object that thrust us into the heart of the nebula? There had been some sketchy characters within the space vessel. Both Donovan and Hyriel had been acting differently since they came on board. I wondered if they, we, us, might've become part of a ploy of gods. Donovan, normally a very cheerful person, had become secluded. Occasionally, indecipherable sounds were heard from his cabin on the south side of the vessel. He shared the cabin with Hyriel, so I figured they were just getting it on, but looking back the sounds were hard to attribute to acts of promiscuity. They were more.. mechanical in nature. There was a very precise rhythm in the sounds. Klunk Klunk. Klunk Klunk."

   {:tag :br, :attrs nil, :content nil}
   "No, it wouldn't make any sense for that to be Loki. Since when was Loki ever mechanical? Was it Hyriel instead? Was her body taken over by Loki? It's a possibility, but the same problem arose as for Donovan. The mechanical sounds were still unexplained. Maybe Laura had snuck in. She was a tinkerer, and she was responsible for the safety of the vessel, but she hadn't really acted out of character. I hadn't known Laura for longer than a year, but she had seemed like the same old Laura that she always was."

   "Suddenly, I come to the realization that the Klunk sounds might not have come from the inside of Donovan and Hyriel's room, but from the outside. Perhaps it wasn't infiltration, but a projectile sent to intercept us. The Bylesian Security Service would have a lot to gain on an \"accident\". Their services were barely being used anymore with the last accident fading from memory. They would be capable of creating an anomaly to blast us out of the stratosphere. Given this is uncharted space, the easy excuse would be to blame it on something that we don't know about. Demand for security would increase, and suddenly they'd find their way back into the heart of space exploration. They certainly wouldn't make the same mistake they made in the past ten years. It would also explain the Klunking sound as a planted homing device for the anomaly to home in on."

Getting rid of these energies seemed like the only way to avoid my own energy signature ending up in that place where no energy signatures came out. Since it sounded like a good idea to start there, I wondered how to take it out. Was that even possible as a spirit? I haven't gotten my degree in spirit physics yet so I guess I'll just have to wing it. Using sheer willpower, I try pulling myself away from the void. It didn't have much effect. In fact it had no god damn effect at all unless all these stars and souls in front of me are just in a dancing mood today."

The feeling of injustice became so strong that I could feel a surge of energy bubbling up to the surface from my inner being.

It was puzzling how little I cared for my crewmates in life, yet how much I cared for them in death.

She just couldn't resist tinkering with everything and, well, everyone. Laura had an eye on Rupert for a while, but he never picked up on the signals. Too busy with his project. Such a one track mind, that guy. My only concern with this theory is that the Klunky sounds were in a very robotic fashion; a strict rhythm with almost no variation in the intervals.

Unfortunately I missed the chance to ask her how she did it whilst she was still alive which might've been useful in this situation.

With intellect, she basically meant herself and I was pretty much her toy boy. A nice mindless distraction for the after work hours. To be honest, I didn't mind the role too much, didn't have much self worth to go around anyway and she did actually seem to enjoy my presence. Rest of the crew wasn't as happy to see me, but eh."

I actually had studied cooking for a bit, but the equipment on a spaceship meant for exploration was less than hospitable for proper cooking, and all the ingredients were replicated which doesn't quite have the same flavour as things you grow in your own little space.

Had I known she took offense to it, I wouldn't have left an open tube of toothpaste under her pillow either. Learning these things late was a little regrettable, but feeling the genuine, mutual love which I had always doubted over the years was incredibly comforting, which made the departure as this fucking robot thing tore her apart from me all the more painful.

The creature hobbles towards me and telepathically asks me why I'm in such a hurry to meet oblivion. I tell it that I'm ready to meet my fate and whatever lies beyond.

Rupert always had his nose so fucking high in the air I always wondered how he didn’t get dizzy with how thin the atmosphere was up there. If there was dangerous tech left lying about, or the shattered remains of glasses, it was always Laura; woman would forget her own head if it wasn’t attached, and her lack of common sense is pretty fucking legendary. Always had at least four pairs of magnifying glasses on her person, for her work she’d always said. I think she just liked smashing things; I know the look of a person that just wants to hurt something. Adam I’d liked on his less whiny days; when I got him to shut up about his fucking sensors and got a drink in him, he’d actually been funny. Juliana had been paranoid of me, like she was of everyone. I’d asked her once about the runic token on a chain around her neck, and she’d nearly bit my fucking head off; I’d given her a wide berth after that. Donovan and Hyriel…Well, I hadn’t seen much of them. I’d been pretty jealous of that situation actually; must be nice to have someone you can confide in that completely, to have someone foil you so well. Also, I’d always just assumed they were banging instead of being antisocial. Ozzie, that storage employee kid; he’s blathering on in the afterlife about his damn dog. And about how much of a looker I am; don’t have to tell me. In the cacophonous deluge of thoughts assaulting my un-mind, his are the only I can clearly pick out. I read the rest of them through that peculiar sense of feel; rage, paranoia, disbelief, and above all, fear. I tune them out as best I can and try to wrap my mind around what happened to us."

Juliana had thought Donovan and Hyriel had been acting strangely, but I’d hardly considered it a security concern.

I still taste acrid metal, feel it coating my throat; even in death, fighting the Blyesian brainwashing takes its toll. The security service is a hulking, defunct beast built with the blood of those I’d helped destroy; a desperately hungry animal clawing at scraps. Just because they turned me into a killing machine they expected me to follow them around blindly for the rest of my life? Did that, died in their service, no thanks. As cold as I am, though, I never wanted people to get caught in the crossfire like this. Who blows up a whole ship for one woman?
