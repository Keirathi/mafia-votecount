VT is the core of the game, the power roles are the fluff (especially in games like this one with only two power roles).

   ".  On its face, Trfel's push on me looks a bit ballsy and therefore towny.  The problem that I have with actually reading the push as towny specifically is that it's clearly something that he planned to do before the game started.  In that regard, I'm a bit more leery of DP's townread on Trfel based on that alone because I think town!DP would've equally applied pressure both towards Trfel for a stupid push on a vet to clarify as to what Trfel's actual reason for the push is.  I remember reading the first few pages before heading to D&D and initially feeling like DP felt a bit off, but not being able to really coalesce that notion in any reasonable way.  Regardless, DP is a prolific poster and a great player; if I can't make a case on him by the end of night 1, then don't lynch him until D3."

For example, TheWarWaffle made maybe about 6 posts in all of Day 1 last game, and he was town.  Meanwhile, Half the Sky made many posts, and she was scum.  The main point against coolTLname is how he waited for GlowingBear to vote The Shining before he voted.

I know that I did this in my first game of TL mafia, and still do sometimes (I wait to see how the first few people react to my case before I vote, in case there is an obvious hole that I missed; perhaps as I improve more and become more confident I will vote without waiting for responses first).  That doesn't mean that new players aren't expected to stand by their reads, but it is reasonable for them to look to veterans for leadership at times.")}

   "I generally like the way that Damdred and GlowingBear have been playing so far.  Their analysis shows that they are reading the thread and trying to scumhunt, as well as generating discussion.  I did notice that GlowingBear provided a lot of comments on posts in the thread, and I liked those.  However, he also provided overall reads, but didn't show why he made those reads (they also didn't necessarily align with the comments he provided).  The recent vote on Breshke is a continuation of this.  However, I'm sure either of them could play a very capable scum game as well.  Not a good Day 1 lynch."

I do like that he picked up on LightingStrike's weird play at the start of the game.  That was the same feeling that I got.  However, he hasn't done very much at all except for saying that my opening made it seem that I am town.  My opening doesn't really say anything about my alignment for reasons previously stated by geript, however the way I followed it up is more important (more on this later).  For the record, several of you seem to be familiar with DarthPunk's playstyle, and I am completely unfamiliar with it, so that doesn't help."

Still, I take note that jarjar said that she is capable of doing this as either alignment.  One thing I did find really strange is that rsoultin provided her thoughts using a Damdred quote.  I have no idea why she would do this except to compare opinions, but she didn't provide any thoughts on Damdred (I know their thoughts on other players were side by side, but still), and it gave the impression that her reads were less independent."

   "I do need to clarify that based on how last game (Newbie Mafia) went and my postgame discussions with GlowingBear, I have been trying a slightly different playstyle this game.  My opening attempted to generate discussion, and a relatively large number of posts were made about it (the quality of the discussion it generated is more questionable, so perhaps it didn't work out as I intended).  The reason I pushed that (false) viewpoint was because I wanted to get as much discussion from it as possible, which I believe I did.  As for providing less content per post than in previous games, this is a conscious change I made after seeing how last game went.  Brief summary of my play in last game: there wasn't much discussion on the first day, and I was busy, so I didn't share many thoughts or put in the effort that I wanted, and then I died.  My death provided absolutely nothing for town to work with, since I hadn't shared any thoughts as they were not anywhere near conclusive.  This game I am trying to share my thoughts more frequently to prevent something like that from happening again.  The downside is that my posts will not contain as much quality content as I would like, but I believe that I have provided enough content.  Everything I say is there for a reason (in the case of the coolTLname paragraph, the reason is because I don't want to delete it; not always the best reason, but whatever)."

I think Tubesock's passive beginning was only due to the low amount of traffic it received, and that his \"coming out of his shell\" was him realizing that he could take advantage of it. Several times he has posted about the inactivity of the thread, which seems redundant when your very post makes it active. Tubesock only did this to make it look like he cares. A Mafia player wants there to be confusion, chaos, and distrust in the thread. Do Tubesock's actions create clear, organized discussion? I don't think so."

Although at face value, the fact that you responded to why you thought the No lynch was a good idea seemed believable to me, it struck me as odd that you thought you didn't see a Cop/Doctor setup(setup A) and that sent you on a full Google search for Mafia strats and that's how you came up with the NL.  Mate, couldn't you just check the OP and see at least one setup did in fact have a cop + doc? And in an open setup game, how sure can you be that any of the 3 setups is the one we're playing? The only way you'd know that is as scum.  Was that a slip?  The rest of your posts are responses and defenses to questions about your opening, and summaries.  I could maybe be convinced to lynch but the fact that you are asking questions of Damdred as well as responding thinks you might deserve a Lil BoD for D1, at least.

Things like how much pressure a player is under, experience level, amount of vet influence, scum activity level, player ability to be active, etc.  There's too many things to factor in.  Stop.  Play at least 20 games before you start using meta.  It looks all nice and shiny, but coming from someone who uses definitely overuses meta to my own detriment, stop.

   ".  As a coach, both the coach and the coachee learn.  The coach gets to understand how players think and operate (especially as town) normally.  I find it quite odd that GB isn't making any sort of argument based on his knowledge of his understanding of how Breshke approaches the game (even post coaching).  There's no confirmable expectation for Breshke to meet here.  Not only that, Breshke is essentially doing nothing.  It's really odd that he's making a point about Breshke not doing what GB would expect, when Breshke is pretty clearly not doing anything.  I don't expect much from GB in general, but his particular filter strikes me as subpar even for him.  It's also a bit weird to me that GB hasn't added any reasoning whatsoever for Damdred.  Damdred's a player who has a history of being incorrectly read and GB has played with Damdred a bunch IIRC.  Especially seeing as GB clears Damdred pretty early today (after losing to mafia!Damdred in Imperial), it's quite odd that he's so bare on that subject.  Also, look at the reasoning for the WW read; LS pulled something very similar that I pointed out in my first post towards DP.  I find it odd that GB is picking up on a worse read for WW than on a better one for LS."

However, coolTLname, while post count and mafia are related, there are many other more important tells.  For example, TheWarWaffle made maybe about 6 posts in all of Day 1 last game, and he was town.  Meanwhile, Half the Sky made many posts, and she was scum.  The main point against coolTLname is how he waited for GlowingBear to vote The Shining before he voted.  However, assuming that coolTLname really is new to TL, this makes sense, since it is reasonable for a new player to wait and see how the veterans react to things they bring up.  I know that I did this in my first game of TL mafia, and still do sometimes (I wait to see how the first few people react to my case before I vote, in case there is an obvious hole that I missed; perhaps as I improve more and become more confident I will vote without waiting for responses first).  That doesn't mean that new players aren't expected to stand by their reads, but it is reasonable for them to look to veterans for leadership at times.")}

However, he also provided overall reads, but didn't show why he made those reads (they also didn't necessarily align with the comments he provided).

My opening doesn't really say anything about my alignment for reasons previously stated by geript, however the way I followed it up is more important (more on this later).  For the record, several of you seem to be familiar with DarthPunk's playstyle, and I am completely unfamiliar with it, so that doesn't help."

That aside, while jarjar's opening post is pretty horrible, he has given some useful thoughts since then.  As for rsoultin, I feel that her play lines up exactly with (my knowledge of) her town meta.  I also liked the questioning that she used with regards to my opening.  Still, I take note that jarjar said that she is capable of doing this as either alignment.  One thing I did find really strange is that rsoultin provided her thoughts using a Damdred quote.  I have no idea why she would do this except to compare opinions, but she didn't provide any thoughts on Damdred (I know their thoughts on other players were side by side, but still), and it gave the impression that her reads were less independent."

         "I do need to clarify that based on how last game (Newbie Mafia) went and my postgame discussions with GlowingBear, I have been trying a slightly different playstyle this game.  My opening attempted to generate discussion, and a relatively large number of posts were made about it (the quality of the discussion it generated is more questionable, so perhaps it didn't work out as I intended).  The reason I pushed that (false) viewpoint was because I wanted to get as much discussion from it as possible, which I believe I did.  As for providing less content per post than in previous games, this is a conscious change I made after seeing how last game went.  Brief summary of my play in last game: there wasn't much discussion on the first day, and I was busy, so I didn't share many thoughts or put in the effort that I wanted, and then I died.  My death provided absolutely nothing for town to work with, since I hadn't shared any thoughts as they were not anywhere near conclusive.  This game I am trying to share my thoughts more frequently to prevent something like that from happening again.  The downside is that my posts will not contain as much quality content as I would like, but I believe that I have provided enough content.  Everything I say is there for a reason (in the case of the coolTLname paragraph, the reason is because I don't want to delete it; not always the best reason, but whatever)."

Several times he has posted about the inactivity of the thread, which seems redundant when your very post makes it active. Tubesock only did this to make it look like he cares.

Numerous one liners, unexplained reads, going from questioning Trfels opening as his prior coach of his to \"definitely Town.\"  You keep going at the lurkers and although I do agree lurking and inactivity is suspicious,  I also believe that if scum is actively posting, it would be low hanging fruit for them to push a quiet or inactive Townie.  There is nothing clearly indicating to me whether you are scumhunting or mislynching.  One of the only things I found myself agreeing with you on was LS's BS meter question being pointless and getting him nowhere.  However, in past town games of his I dove and the last Newbie, he doesn't fear saying and asking what is on his mind, even something as trivial as that.  If anything, it rings more towny to me that he is literally spewing out whatever on his mind as soon as it enters his mind, as a town coach told me to do this once upon a time.

However, coolTLname, while post count and mafia are related, there are many other more important tells.  For example, TheWarWaffle made maybe about 6 posts in all of Day 1 last game, and he was town.  Meanwhile, Half the Sky made many posts, and she was scum.  The main point against coolTLname is how he waited for GlowingBear to vote The Shining before he voted.  However, assuming that coolTLname really is new to TL, this makes sense, since it is reasonable for a new player to wait and see how the veterans react to things they bring up.  I know that I did this in my first game of TL mafia, and still do sometimes (I wait to see how the first few people react to my case before I vote, in case there is an obvious hole that I missed; perhaps as I improve more and become more confident I will vote without waiting for responses first).  That doesn't mean that new players aren't expected to stand by their reads, but it is reasonable for them to look to veterans for leadership at times.")}

The reason I pushed that (false) viewpoint was because I wanted to get as much discussion from it as possible, which I believe I did.  As for providing less content per post than in previous games, this is a conscious change I made after seeing how last game went.  Brief summary of my play in last game: there wasn't much discussion on the first day, and I was busy, so I didn't share many thoughts or put in the effort that I wanted, and then I died.  My death provided absolutely nothing for town to work with, since I hadn't shared any thoughts as they were not anywhere near conclusive.

Claim aside, why would he even sign up for the game if he doesn't want to play VT, the most common role?  VT is the core of the game, the power roles are the fluff (especially in games like this one with only two power roles).  Side note, I've been cop/tracker twice out of three previous games, and it hasn't been particularly enjoyable for me.  VT is a much more enjoyable role IMO, less pressure and you can more freely speak your mind."

I also like the analysis of jarjarbinks.  However, coolTLname, while post count and mafia are related, there are many other more important tells.  For example, TheWarWaffle made maybe about 6 posts in all of Day 1 last game, and he was town.  Meanwhile, Half the Sky made many posts, and she was scum.  The main point against coolTLname is how he waited for GlowingBear to vote The Shining before he voted.  However, assuming that coolTLname really is new to TL, this makes sense, since it is reasonable for a new player to wait and see how the veterans react to things they bring up.  I know that I did this in my first game of TL mafia, and still do sometimes (I wait to see how the first few people react to my case before I vote, in case there is an obvious hole that I missed; perhaps as I improve more and become more confident I will vote without waiting for responses first).  That doesn't mean that new players aren't expected to stand by their reads, but it is reasonable for them to look to veterans for leadership at times.")}

As for providing less content per post than in previous games, this is a conscious change I made after seeing how last game went.  Brief summary of my play in last game: there wasn't much discussion on the first day, and I was busy, so I didn't share many thoughts or put in the effort that I wanted, and then I died.  My death provided absolutely nothing for town to work with, since I hadn't shared any thoughts as they were not anywhere near conclusive.

He claims it was a reaction test, but his reaction is not one a town would generally make. Instead of talking it through and trying to understand alignments of both he retreats from the confrontation and says just do analysis on everyone else.

I wake up at 6 when i go to work with him and get ready to leave the house around 7. After this it involves a ton of driving during which i was phone posting in the thread. I have a Samsung galaxy S2 which is a fairly old phone ive had it for a number of years now and it does this weird thing where it randomly heats up using all the battery and killing the phone. So after an hour of trying to keep up with the thread my phone starts fucking up so i turn it off to try cool the battery and it doesn't turn back on hence battery is dead.")})}

I think if Shining were town, when there was a slight push towards him near the EoD3 he would've been a much easier target than Breshke.  Like if he's town, his lynch says little to nothing about Breshke/LM and town is likely to be wifom focused on them D4.  Shining's pretty low impact this game and I think almost anyone could easily come up with reasons to head towards him easily.  Except that for most of today and much of yesterday, few if any have really taken a hard look into him.  Few care.  For town, to some extent that can be normal.

I think if Shining were town, when there was a slight push towards him near the EoD3 he would've been a much easier target than Breshke.

Those posts are really hard to fake as mafia because of how invested you have to be as playing mafia while still creating natural progressions.  It's one of the major reasons why I don't really scumhunt.  It's so much easier to find people who you find to be town and just lynch all the other fuckers.

I'd have probably tried to do a no-lynch, since trading geript for 72 hours and easier coordination is probably worth it. With 4 townies, 1 townie voting wrong and some bad timing is enough to lose; you need to wrangle 4 people rather than 3. With 3 townies, you don't have to wrangle as many people together, though the signal:noise ratio is worse.  The real solution would be to be better organized D4 but that's easier said than done.")}

You see, the problem is that Damdred was town and gained info. If he was scum, though this wouldn't be a problem, so I wouldn't need to replace him. I can't take actions that depend on player alignments (they need to be alignment-agnostic) so in situations like this I need to categorically replace or modkill Damdred, or modkill the offender.
