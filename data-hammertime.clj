Mafia can emulate (1) just fine and regularly do (which is why I just called him a chill dude instead of something alignment-indicative), mafia have a harder time with (2) and especially with (3) - (2) because they struggle to get into a townie mindset and ask questions that make sense / are going somewhere (although it's not a "
